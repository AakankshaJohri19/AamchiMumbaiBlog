							<p>
									Mumbai, formerly Bombay, city, capital of Maharashtra state, southwestern India.
								    It is the country's financial and commercial centre and its principal port on the Arabian Sea.
									<br>Mumbai, long the centre of India's cotton textile industry, subsequently developed a highly diversified manufacturing sector that included an increasingly important information technology (IT) component. In addition, the city's commercial and financial institutions are strong and vigorous, and Mumbai serves as the country's financial hub.
									The natural beauty of Mumbai is unsurpassed by that of most other cities in the region. The entrance into Mumbai Harbour from the sea discloses a magnificent panorama framed by the Western Ghats mountain range on the mainland. The wide harbour, studded with islands and dotted with the white sails of innumerable small craft, affords secure shelter to ships, particularly when storms lash the coast. The largest of the harbour's islands is Elephanta, which is famous for its 8th- and 9th-century Hindu cave temples.
									<br>
									
									The name Mumbai is derived from Maha Amba or Mumba - the name of the patron goddess Mumba Devi of the native Koli community. Mumbai, also known as Bombay, is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra and the "de facto" financial state of India.
									<br>Population : Mumbai is the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million. It was named an alpha world city and has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India.
									<br>Cosmopolitan Culture : Mumbai has a blend of traditional and cosmopolitan cultures due to its history as a major trading centre, resulting in a diverse range of cultures, religions and cuisines coexisting in the city.
								    <br>Indian Cinema : The city of Mumbai is the birthplace of Indian cinema. It has contemporary art featured in art spaces and private commercial galleries.The Hindi film industry based in Mumbai, called Bollywood, produces nearly 170 to 200 films every year. Slumdog Millionaire, an English-language British film, was shot entirely in Mumbai and bagged 8 Oscar Awards.
								    <br>Beaches : Beaches are a major tourist attraction in the city. Juhu Beach, Aksa Beach and Marve Beach are some of the well-known beaches in the city.

									<h3>
										Imposing, exuberant and overflowing with people, this monumental train station is the city's most extravagant Gothic building and an aphorism of colonial-era India. It's a meringue of Victorian, Hindu and Islamic styles whipped into an imposing Dal√≠-esque structure of buttresses, domes, turrets, spires and stained glass. 
										It's also known as CSMT. Some of the architectural detail is incredible, with dog-faced gargoyles adorning the magnificent central tower and peacock-filled windows above the central courtyard. 
										Designed by Frederick Stevens, it was completed in 1887, 34 years after the first train in India left this site.
										Despite being renamed again in 2017, after being changed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) in 1998, it's still better known locally as VT.

									<h3>
										Nariman Point today is a premium business hub with some internationally renowned business, financial and industrial houses. 
										Strewn with many skyscrapers, Nariman Point gives a stunning impression of Manhattan and therefore, had been designated as the 'Manhattan of Mumbai'. 
										All the major banks and their headquarters are located in this area. Also, it houses some major airline offices. 
										One can find several extortionate residential condos, Mittal Towers, Birla Bhavan and Vidhya Bhavan, the political head office of the State of Maharashtra. Ever since it was built, Nariman Point has been eyed by investors and industrialists to have their offices set up there.

										The Elephanta Caves are widely thought to have been constructed sometime around the 6th century AD, either by king Krishnaraja of the Kalachuri Dynasty or by Chalukya Dynasty rulers. 
										These dynasties were established in the region after the decline of the Vakataka Dynasty in the 6th century.
										The island was called Elephanta Island by the Portuguese in the 16th century after they acquired it from the Gujarat Sultanate and discovered a sizeable rock-cut stone elephant statue there (the figure is now on display outside the Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai).
